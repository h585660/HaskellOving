ðŸ§™ Haskell Assignments: A Semester's Journey ðŸ“š
Welcome, dear wanderer, to a compendium of Haskell assignments from a semester filled with functional adventures! Herein lie numerous treasures â€” each Haskell file is a chronicle of a problem solved, a riddle unraveled, and a functional challenge overcome.

ðŸ¤” What Lies Within This Repository?
Countless Haskell Files: Each one a mandatory assignment that proves my allegiance to the land of Haskell.
Tales of Simple Adventures: While the challenges were simple, they were no less significant. Don't expect any high-octane battles with Monads or epic duels with IO actions. It's more like... a gentle stroll through the Haskell countryside.
More to Come!: As the semester progresses, more Haskell tales will be added to this repository. Stay tuned for more stories of functional delight!
ðŸš« A Word of Caution:
Many of these files were designed to be handed into CodeGrade, armed with their own integrated main(). They might not run straight out of the gate. But hey, even Excalibur didn't just let anyone wield it, right?

In Short: These are not meant to be executed directly. Admire them, learn from them, but don't expect them to perform any magical feats when run. Unless you're really interested in diving deep into Haskell, it's probably best to just peruse them for their inherent beauty.

ðŸ“œ 
Open the Haskell file you wish to delve into using your preferred text editor.
Marvel at the elegant simplicity of functional programming.
ðŸŒŒ Parting Words:
Whether you're a student of Haskell, an aficionado of functional programming, or just a curious soul, I hope these assignments provide some insight, or at the very least, a moment of enjoyment.

Feel free to star this repository if you find it helpful, and may your Haskell journey be ever enlightening!
